Table: Product

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
| unit_price   | int     |
+--------------+---------+

Each row of this table indicates the name and the price of each product.
Table: Sales

+-------------+---------+

| sale_date   | date    |
| quantity    | int     |
| price       | int     |

This table has no primary key, it can have repeated rows.
product_id is a foreign key to the Product table.
Each row of this table contains some information about one sale.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the best seller by total sales price, If there is a tie, report them all.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Input: 
Product table:

+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation: Both sellers with id 1 and 3 sold products with the most total price of 2800.

1083. Sales Analysis II


Write an SQL query that reports the buyers who have bought S8 but not iPhone. Note that S8 and iPhone are products present in the Product table.

+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
Explanation: The buyer with id 1 bought an S8 but did not buy an iPhone. The buyer with id 3 bought both.
*/

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select S.buyer_id
from Product as P inner join Sales as S
on P.product_id = S.product_id
group by S.buyer_id
having (
  sum(p.product_name = 'S8') > 0 and sum(P.product_name = 'iPhone') = 0
)

/*
when you say COUNT(condition), MySQL doesn't count 'true' or 'false' outcomes. 
The COUNT() function is typically used to count rows, not conditions.

However, in MySQL, SUM(condition) treats 'true' as 1 and 'false' as 0. 
So when you say SUM(p.product_name = 'S8') > 0, MySQL is summing 1 for each 'true' outcome and 0 for each 'false' one.

So, SUM(condition) is a common way to count the number of 'true' outcomes of a condition in SQL, 
while COUNT(condition) would not achieve this result because COUNT doesn't interpret the condition as SUM does.

Example 1:

Input: 
Product table:
+------------+--------------+------------+
| product_id | product_name | unit_price |

| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+
Sales table:
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| seller_id | product_id | buyer_id | sale_date  | quantity | price |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| 1         | 1          | 1        | 2019-01-21 | 2        | 2000  |

Explanation: 
The product with id 1 was only sold in the spring of 2019.
The product with id 2 was sold in the spring of 2019 but was also sold after the spring of 2019.
The product with id 3 was sold after spring 2019.
We return only product 1 as it is the product that was only sold in the spring of 2019.
